# Distributed dask on Docker

I was working on this as a research alternative to fighting the Spark / MapReduce workflows in highly iterative algorithms run on a cluster.

Of course, I quickly discovered [Oliver Grisel](https://github.com/ogrisel/) had already done something [very similar and arguably more robust](https://github.com/ogrisel/docker-distributed). Still, different use-cases and simple stubborn curiosity compelled me to keep working on my own.

## Overview

This is a [HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL] containerized implementation of [distributed](http://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [dask](http://dask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you're really curious, check out [Matthew Rocklin's blog posts on the topic](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2016/02/17/dask-distributed-part1).

More details to come as the implementation progresses.
